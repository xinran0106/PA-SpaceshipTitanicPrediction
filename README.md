# PA-SpaceshipTitanicPrediction

This project aims to solve a mysterious problem: in the year 2912, the Spaceship Titanic was 
traveling in the sea of stars to its destinations, three newly habitable exoplanets orbiting nearby 
stars. Sadly, it faced the same tragedy as its namesake 1000 thousand years ago: while the 
spaceship remained intact, almost half of its passengers were lost to an alternate dimension. In 
order to save both the current passengers and passengers in the future, as data scientists, our 
group needs to build predictive models to predict what kind of passengers are likely to be lost to 
another dimension, using the data records of the current passengers. 

At first glance, this mystery problem may seem to be unrelated to real-world applications, as we 
are trying to solve a fictional prediction problem. However, we believe this project has a 
significant underlying realistic impact. In the real world of predictive modeling, it is very 
common that the target value and features seem not to be very related according to common 
sense, and even worse, some features may also remain concealed inside the raw data records. In 
such scenarios, the responsibility of data scientists is to try to figure out possible related features, 
extract and format out useful features from the raw data through EDA, and subsequently choose 
suitable models and fine-tune the hyperparameters. We believe that through this project, we will 
be able to build a systematic approach applicable to not only this fictional problem but also other 
similar predictive tasks.
